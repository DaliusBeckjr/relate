## **Contribution Guidelines for Relate**

Thank you for considering contributing to **Relate**! Contributions of all kinds are welcome, from bug fixes to new features. To maintain the quality and consistency of the project, please follow these guidelines.

### **1. Getting Started**
- **Fork the repository**: Create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
- **Clone your fork**: Clone your fork locally to work on it.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Relate.git
  cd Relate
  ```
- **Create a new branch**: Create a feature branch to keep your work isolated.
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- **Set up the development environment**: Follow the steps in the `README.md` to set up the project locally. Ensure the app is working correctly before making any changes.

### **2. How to Contribute**
- **Bug Fixes**: If you encounter a bug, feel free to submit a fix. Please make sure there isn't already an issue or pull request addressing the same bug.
- **New Features**: Before working on a new feature, please create an issue to discuss the idea and align on implementation.
- **Documentation**: Contributions to improve documentation are encouraged! If you notice any missing or unclear information, submit a pull request.
- **Code Style**: Follow the existing coding style in the repository (PEP8 for Python, standard practices for React). 

### **3. Issues**
If you'd like to report a bug, request a feature, or have a question:
- **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
- Open a **new issue** with a clear description of the problem or feature request.
- If it's a bug, provide the steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

### **4. Pull Requests (PRs)**
- **Ensure tests pass**: If you've added new code, make sure to include relevant tests and ensure all tests pass.
- **Describe your PR**: Clearly describe what the pull request does, including any related issue numbers, how you approached the problem, and why the solution works.
- **Small, focused PRs**: Make sure your PR is focused on a single change or feature. Larger PRs are harder to review.
- **Code Review**: PRs will be reviewed by maintainers. Please be open to feedback and ready to make changes if requested.

### **5. Code of Conduct**
By contributing, you agree to follow the project's **Code of Conduct**. Please ensure that you:
